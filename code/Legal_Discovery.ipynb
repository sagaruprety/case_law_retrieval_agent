In almost all cases of the poor ryots, the major portion of their produce finds its way into the hands of the village money-lender and whatever remains is sold to petty traders who tour the villages and the price at which it changes hands is governed not so much by the market rates, but by the urgent needs of the ryot which are generally taken advantage of by the purchaser.

Once that is so, sale of manufactured tea in packed condition within the market area would squarely attract the charge u/s. 27 of the Act which, as noted earlier, is widely worded.

M. 18), and addressed to the different branch managers, starts by saying that according to industrial decisions the status of an employee has to be determined not by his designation but by reference to the nature of the work that he does.

Since these two letters were sent to the different branch managers before giving effect to the two grades announced by circular No. 249, it is obvious that the said circular and the two letters formed part of the same transaction, and the statement in the said circular that all existing confirmed supervisors shall be placed in grade II became an empty promise; only such supervisors were confirmed as agreed to treat themselves as officers, and those who claimed the status of workman were not confirmed.It appeared that after the employees were sounded by sending the two confidential letters the appellant decided to take the next step; and so it issued circular No. 292 (Ex.

The next argument is that the award made by the tribunal is outside its jurisdiction, because relief granted by the award covers persons other than those who have been promoted to grade II. This contention is also based on the same misconstruction of the terms of reference. It assumes that the reference is confined to persons who have been promoted, and so it seeks to limit the scope of the reference as to relief to the same class of persons. If, on the other hand, the reference is in regard to the validity of the conditions sought to be imposed by the impugned circular, then the nature and extent of the relief would also be similarly extended.', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/Object_casedocs_500/C102.txt'}),\n",

He has also contended that the tribunal was in error in attributing to the appellant a well-planned scheme by which the appellant intended to deprive the respondents of the arrears of special allowance to which they were entitled under the award.

That at any rate must have been the object with which the confidential letter was issued.

In regard to circular No. 249 it is impossible to accept the argument that it is either innocent or is not connected with the scheme evolved by the appellant for the purpose of depriving the respondents of their legitimate rights under the award.

This Court said that the two requirements for compulsory retirement were that the officer had completed 25 years of service and that it was in public interest to dispense with his further services.

              "\"In this dispute, the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board (CSEB) invited tenders for the Designing, Engineering, Testing, Supply, Erection & Commission of HEA Ignition system at Hasedeo Thermal Power Station (Korba West). The respondent, M/s Control Electronics India (CEI), submitted an application for the tender documents but it was rejected due to incomplete documents, specifically the non-submission of documentary evidence of past performance and experience. The respondent then complained against the appellant for not issuing the tender documents.\\n\\nHowever, the present case is not about the initial rejection of the respondent's application. Instead, it revolves around the respondent's allegations that the records were fabricated and the tender document was not opened and returned in furtherance of official duties by the appellant.\\n\\nThe Court has carefully examined the impugned advertisement issued by the Nagar Nigam and found no illegality in it. The Court has also considered the report of Ram, the General Manager of the Power Station, which stated that the respondent's equipment supplied at Patratu Thermal Power Station, Patratu, Jharkhand was not functioning well. The Tender Committee took this information into account and rejected the respondent's tender as he failed to comply with the pre-qualifying conditions despite being asked multiple times to submit the required performance report.\\n\\nTherefore, this dispute is related to the rejection of the respondent's tender by the CSEB based on the non-fulfillment of the pre-qualifying conditions.\""

However, he withdrew the suit, leading to its dismissal for non-prosecution. The respondent's attempt to challenge the decision of the Tender Committee in not considering his tender was unfaulted due to the constructive res judicata effect of the withdrawn suit. The tender of the respondent was rejected due to the defects in the scanning system supplied by him, which adversely affected the generation at Patratu Thermal Power Station. The Tender Committee sought expert opinions and rejected the respondent's tender based on the reports received. The allegations of fabricating records made by the respondent were considered mischievous and an afterthought. The appellant, R.C. Jain, was deputed to verify the claim of the respondent, and he reported that the works carried out by the respondent at Patratu Thermal Power Station were not satisfactory. Based on this information, the respondent's tender document was not opened and returned.\""
